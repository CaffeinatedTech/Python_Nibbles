Python Nibbles
==============
This is the code from the tutorial on youtube where we 
create the snake game in Python using the Pyxel engine.

Check out the tutorial [here](https://youtu.be/Qg16VhEo2Qs)

### Requirements
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org)
* [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel)

### Building Executable
You can use the pyxel tool `pyxelpackager`

You will need [PyInstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/) installed to do this

```
pyxelpackager main.py
```
When the process is complete, a stand-alone executable is created in the `dist` folder.
